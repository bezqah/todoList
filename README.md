This project explores React components and using them to dynamically create a todo list which gives the user the capabilities to add and remove items from the list. The components and functions of the program are done 
through separation of concerns which splits the program by funcionality allowing for cleaner and more reusable code. It uses concepts like useState, components, and various CSS styles to enhance capabilities. The programmer
also added functionality to add some bootstrap buttons and checkmarks to show completed items (checked or unchecked).
